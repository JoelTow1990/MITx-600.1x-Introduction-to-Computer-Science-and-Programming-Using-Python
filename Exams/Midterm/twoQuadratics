"""
Write a Python function, twoQuadratics, that takes in two sets of coefficients and x-values and prints the sum of the results of evaluating 
two quadratic equations. It does not do anything else. That is, you should evaluate and print the result of the following equation:  
a1∗x21+b1∗x1+c1+a2∗x22+b2∗x2+c2 
You are given the following function, evalQuadratic

def evalQuadratic(a, b, c, x):
   '''
   a, b, c: numerical values for the coefficients of a quadratic equation
   x: numerical value at which to evaluate the quadratic.
   '''
   return a*x*x + b*x + c
    
Use the given function (you don't need to redefine evalQuadratic in this box; when you call evalQuadratic, our definition will be used).

    First = evalQuadratic(a1,b1,c1,x1)
    Second = evalQuadratic(a2,b2,c2,x2)
    return(print(First + Second))
