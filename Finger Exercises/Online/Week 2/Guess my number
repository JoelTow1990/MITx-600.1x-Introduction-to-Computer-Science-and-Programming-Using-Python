"""
In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!

The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). The computer makes 
guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret 
number!

When the user enters something invalid, you should print out a message to the user explaining you did not understand their input. 
Then, you should re-ask the question, and prompt again for input.
